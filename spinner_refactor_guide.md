# Spinner Module Refactor â€“ Developer Instructions

## Overview

We are undertaking an overhaul of the spinner functionality to improve modularity and maintainability across all parts of the project. The goal is to **encapsulate all spinner-related code** in a dedicated module and enforce a clear separation of concerns. This involves creating a new **`spinner` package** (similar in structure to our existing `ui` package) and using an **abstract class** to handle spinner logic. Each application (web app, documentation site, and browser extension) will provide its own implementation of this abstract class.

## Objectives and Requirements

### 1. Create a Dedicated `spinner` Package

- Set up the new package under `packages/spinner`, structured like `packages/ui`.
- Move existing spinner components and settings UI to this package.

### 2. Design a Shared Abstract Spinner Class

- Define an abstract class (`SpinnerBase`) in the spinner package.
- Spinner components should invoke methods defined by this class, without direct logic.

### 3. Extend the Abstract Class in Each Application

- **Web App:** Implement spinner logic (e.g., API calls, local storage).
- **Documentation App:** Provide minimal or demo implementation.
- **Browser Extension:**

  - The **extension** must contain **all of its logic inside itself**. - The **Side Panel**, **Options**, and **Popup** in the extension will each **reuse the spinner components** from the `spinner` package. - Each of these views will **import the spinner component** they need **and provide it an instance of the `ExtensionSpinnerClient` class**. - `ExtensionSpinnerClient` must **extend the abstract `SpinnerBase` class** and provide **extension-specific implementations** for all required functions (such as loading and saving settings, authenticating with Directus, or local storage interactions specific to Chrome Extension APIs). - This ensures that the spinner components behave the same visually and structurally, but their behavior is correctly tailored for the extension environment.

### 4. Integrate Spinner Components Using Dependency Injection

- Inject the app-specific Spinner service into spinner components (via props/context).
- Components should rely entirely on the provided service for logic.

### 5. Centralize Settings Storage on the Server

- Store spinner settings on Directus server.
- Local storage limited to authentication tokens.

## Action Plan & Next Steps

### Step 1: Set Up the `spinner` Package

- Establish folder structure and transfer relevant components and UI elements.

### Step 2: Define the Abstract Class in `spinner` Package

- Clearly specify required abstract methods (e.g., `saveSpinnerSettings`, `loadSpinnerSettings`, `getAuthToken`).

### Step 3: Implement Abstract Class in Each Application

- Complete implementations for Web App, Docs App, and Browser Extension as outlined above.

### Step 4: Integrate the Spinner UI with Implementations

- Update components to use the abstract class methods exclusively.

### Step 5: Server-Side Settings Confirmation

- Validate consistent server-side storage of settings.
- Conduct thorough testing across all apps.

## Documentation & Handoff

- Provide clear documentation within the spinner package.
- Plan for a detailed code review and testing cycle.

## Conclusion

Following these guidelines will ensure the spinner module is modular, maintainable, and consistently implemented across our platforms.
