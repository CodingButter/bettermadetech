## Development Workflow

1. **Development Mode**:
   ```bash
   cd apps/extension
   pnpm dev
   ```
   Opens a browser with a development version of the extension where:
   - Chrome APIs are mocked
   - You can navigate between different parts of the extension
   - Hot reloading works for rapid development

2. **Extension Mode**:
   ```bash
   cd apps/extension
   pnpm build:extension
   ```
   Creates a distributable Chrome extension in the `dist` directory that can be loaded into Chrome.

## Architecture Notes

- The project uses a monorepo structure with shared packages
- The extension lives in `apps/extension` as a full application
- Shared components are in `packages/` directory
- The spinner component is designed to be reused across applications
- Chrome APIs are mocked for development but used directly in production
