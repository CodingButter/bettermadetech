# CMS Documentation

## Overview

We use Directus as our headless CMS to manage content across our digital properties. It provides a flexible and customizable API for our content.

## Technology Stack

- **Directus 11**: Headless CMS
- **PostgreSQL**: Database
- **Docker**: Containerization

## Project Structure

The CMS code is located in `apps/directus/` with the following structure:

```
directus/
├── data/             # Database data (git ignored)
├── extensions/       # Custom extensions
├── uploads/          # Uploaded files (git ignored)
└── docker-compose.yaml  # Docker configuration
```

## Development

To start the CMS:

```bash
npm run dev:cms
```

This will start the Directus server, typically at http://localhost:8055.

## Content Structure

### Collections

Our CMS is organized into the following collections:

- **Pages**: Website pages
- **Posts**: Blog posts
- **Team**: Team members
- **Services**: Service offerings

### Fields

Each collection has specific fields. For example, a Page has:

- Title
- Slug
- Content blocks
- SEO metadata

## API Usage

Our Next.js application interacts with the CMS using the Directus SDK:

```typescript
import { createDirectus, rest, readItems } from '@directus/sdk';

const directus = createDirectus('https://admin.bettermade.tech').with(rest());

// Example: Fetch all pages
const pages = await directus.request(readItems('pages'));
```
