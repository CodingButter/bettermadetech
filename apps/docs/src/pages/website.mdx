# Website Documentation

## Overview

Our main website is built with Next.js 15 and uses Tailwind CSS v4 for styling. It serves as the primary marketing platform for BetterMade Technology.

## Technology Stack

- **Next.js 15**: For server-side rendering and static site generation
- **React 19**: For component-based UI development
- **Tailwind CSS v4**: For styling
- **Directus CMS**: For content management

## Project Structure

The website code is located in `apps/nextjs/` and follows standard Next.js conventions:

```
nextjs/
├── public/            # Static assets
├── src/
│   ├── app/           # App Router pages and layouts
│   ├── components/     # Reusable UI components
│   ├── lib/           # Utility functions and libraries
│   └── types/         # TypeScript type definitions
```

## Development

To start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev:web
```

This will start the Next.js development server, typically at http://localhost:3000.
