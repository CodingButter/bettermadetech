# Contributing to BetterMade Technology

We love your input! We want to make contributing to BetterMade Technology projects as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

### Issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue.

### Coding Standards

- Use consistent code formatting
- Write tests for your code when possible
- Keep pull requests focused on a single feature or bug fix
- Document your code

## Branch Organization

- `main` - Production-ready code
- `docs` - Documentation website
- `develop` - Integration branch for feature development
- `feature/*` - Feature branches
