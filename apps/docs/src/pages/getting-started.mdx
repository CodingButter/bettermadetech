# Getting Started

This guide will help you set up your development environment and get started with the BetterMade Technology projects.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (version 18 or later)
- npm or yarn
- Docker and Docker Compose (for Directus CMS)
- Git

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CodingButter/bettermadetech.git
cd bettermadetech
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:

Each application has its own environment variables. Check the `.env.example` files in each app directory and create corresponding `.env` files.

## Development

### Running the applications

You can run each application individually:

```bash
# Start Directus CMS
npm run dev:cms

# Start Next.js website
npm run dev:web

# Start documentation site
npm run dev:docs
```

Or run everything in parallel:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Building for production

To build all applications for production:

```bash
npm run build
```
