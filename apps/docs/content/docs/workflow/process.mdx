# Development Process

This document outlines our development process from planning to deployment. Following these guidelines ensures consistent quality and maintainable code.

## Development Lifecycle

Our development follows this cycle:

1. **Planning**: Issues are created and prioritized
2. **Development**: Code is written and tested
3. **Review**: Changes are reviewed and improved
4. **Deployment**: Approved changes are released
5. **Feedback**: User feedback guides future improvements

## Issue Management

### Creating Issues

All work begins with a GitHub issue:

- Use the appropriate issue template
- Add detailed descriptions
- Include acceptance criteria
- Assign appropriate labels
- Link to related issues or documentation

### Issue Workflow

Issues follow this lifecycle:

1. **Triage**: Issues are validated and classified
2. **Backlog**: Prioritized and ready for development
3. **In Progress**: Actively being worked on
4. **Review**: Code is completed and under review
5. **Done**: Issue is resolved and closed

### Issue Tracking

We use GitHub Projects to track issues:

```bash
# Update an issue status using our management tools
./dev-tools/github-project-manager.sh set-status <issue-number> <status>

# Example:
./dev-tools/github-project-manager.sh set-status 42 in-progress
```

## Git Workflow

We follow a feature branch workflow:

1. **Main Branch**: Always contains stable, production-ready code
2. **Feature Branches**: Created for new features, fixes, or improvements
3. **Pull Requests**: Merging changes back to the main branch

### Branch Creation

Create a new branch for each issue:

```bash
# Create a new branch from main
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b feature/42-spinner-color-customization
```

### Committing Changes

Commit your changes frequently with clear messages:

```bash
# Stage your changes
git add .

# Commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Add color customization to spinner component

- Implement color picker UI
- Connect to spinner theme system
- Add color preview functionality

Fixes #42"
```

### Keeping Branches Updated

Keep your branch up to date with main:

```bash
# Update your branch with the latest changes from main
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout feature/42-spinner-color-customization
git merge main
```

### Creating Pull Requests

When your changes are ready:

1. Push your branch to GitHub
   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature/42-spinner-color-customization
   ```

2. Create a pull request
   - Use the PR template
   - Link to the related issue
   - Add a clear description
   - Request reviewers

### Code Review Process

All PRs undergo thorough review:

1. **Automated Checks**: CI pipeline verifies build, tests, and linting
2. **Peer Review**: At least one team member reviews the code
3. **Feedback Loop**: Address any comments or requests for changes
4. **Approval**: Reviewers approve when changes are satisfactory
5. **Merge**: PR is merged to the main branch

## Testing Strategy

We employ a comprehensive testing approach:

### Unit Testing

- Test individual functions and components
- Focus on isolated functionality
- Aim for high coverage of core logic

### Integration Testing

- Test interactions between components
- Verify correct data flow
- Ensure components work together properly

### End-to-End Testing

- Test complete user workflows
- Validate the entire application
- Simulate real user behavior

### Manual Testing

- Test edge cases and complex interactions
- Verify visual and UX elements
- Check cross-browser compatibility

## Documentation

Documentation is a crucial part of our process:

### Code Documentation

- Use JSDoc comments for functions and classes
- Add inline comments for complex logic
- Keep READMEs updated with relevant information

### User Documentation

- Update user guides for new features
- Add examples and screenshots
- Create tutorials for complex workflows

### API Documentation

- Document all public APIs
- Include types, parameters, and return values
- Provide usage examples

## Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment

Our CI/CD pipeline automates checks and deployments:

### CI Checks

For every PR:
- Build verification
- Linting checks
- Unit and integration tests
- Bundle size analysis

### Deployment Process

1. **Development**: Automatic deployment to development environment
2. **Staging**: Manual promotion to staging environment
3. **Production**: Manual promotion to production after approval

## Release Process

We follow a structured release process:

### Version Numbering

We use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):
- MAJOR: Incompatible API changes
- MINOR: New features (backward compatible)
- PATCH: Bug fixes (backward compatible)

### Release Preparation

1. Update version numbers
2. Compile release notes
3. Create a release branch

### Release Verification

1. Deploy to staging environment
2. Conduct final testing
3. Verify all features work as expected

### Release Publication

1. Tag the release in Git
2. Deploy to production
3. Publish to Chrome Web Store (for extension)
4. Announce the release

## Monitoring and Feedback

After deployment, we monitor performance and gather feedback:

### Performance Monitoring

- Track key performance metrics
- Monitor for errors or issues
- Analyze usage patterns

### User Feedback

- Collect feedback through designated channels
- Prioritize feedback for future improvements
- Address critical issues promptly

### Continuous Improvement

- Conduct regular retrospectives
- Identify process improvements
- Implement changes in subsequent iterations

## Project Management Tools

We use these tools to facilitate our process:

- **GitHub**: Issues, PRs, and code hosting
- **GitHub Projects**: Project and sprint tracking
- **Custom Scripts**: Automation for common tasks

```bash
# List all scripts available
ls -la dev-tools/

# View all issues in our project
./dev-tools/github-project-manager.sh list-bettertech-issues
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

If you encounter problems in the development process:

### Git Issues

```bash
# Reset uncommitted changes
git reset --hard

# Undo last commit (keeping changes)
git reset HEAD~1
```

### Dependency Issues

```bash
# Clean and reinstall all dependencies
pnpm clean
pnpm install
```

### Build Issues

```bash
# Clean build caches
rm -rf .turbo
pnpm clean

# Rebuild all packages
pnpm build
```
