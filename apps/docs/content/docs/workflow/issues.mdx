# Issue Management

This document describes our approach to issue management in the Winner Spinner project, including issue creation, tracking, and resolution.

## Issue Lifecycle

Issues in our project follow this lifecycle:

```
Todo → In Progress → Review → Done
```

Each state represents a specific stage:

1. **Todo**: Issue is validated, prioritized, and ready for development
2. **In Progress**: Someone is actively working on the issue
3. **Review**: The work is complete and under review
4. **Done**: The issue is resolved and closed

## Creating Issues

### Issue Templates

We provide several issue templates:

- **Bug Report**: For reporting defects
- **Feature Request**: For suggesting new features
- **Documentation**: For documentation improvements
- **Refactoring**: For code improvement without changing behavior

### Issue Guidelines

When creating an issue:

1. **Use descriptive titles**: Clearly state the problem or feature
2. **Provide context**: Explain why the issue matters
3. **Add reproduction steps**: For bugs, detail how to reproduce
4. **Set realistic expectations**: Be clear about scope and effort
5. **Add appropriate labels**: Help with classification and filtering

### Example: Good Bug Report

```markdown
## Bug: Spinner stops prematurely on Firefox

### Description
The spinner component stops spinning before completing its animation when used in Firefox, but works correctly in Chrome.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Open the spinner demo page
2. Click "Spin" button
3. Observe that the animation stops halfway through in Firefox

### Expected Behavior
The spinner should complete its full animation cycle (3 seconds) before stopping.

### Actual Behavior
The spinner stops after approximately 1.5 seconds.

### Environment
- Firefox: 98.0.2
- OS: Windows 11
- Screen size: 1920x1080

### Additional Notes
This issue does not occur in Chrome 99 or Edge 99.
```

## Tracking Issues

### Project Board

We use GitHub Projects to track issues through their lifecycle:

- Issues are automatically added to the project board when created
- Status is updated manually or through automation
- The board provides an overview of project progress

### Issue Status Management

Update issue status using our project management scripts:

```bash
# Update an issue's status
./dev-tools/github-project-manager.sh set-status <issue-number> <status>

# Example: Mark issue #42 as in progress
./dev-tools/github-project-manager.sh set-status 42 in-progress

# Example: Mark issue #42 as done
./dev-tools/github-project-manager.sh set-status 42 done
```

### Viewing Current Issues

To see all issues in the project:

```bash
# List all issues and their status
./dev-tools/github-project-manager.sh list-bettertech-issues
```

## Working with Issues

### Starting Work on an Issue

Before you start:

1. **Claim the issue**: Comment that you're working on it
2. **Update the status**: Set status to "In Progress"
3. **Create a branch**: Use the naming convention `type/issue-number-description`

```bash
# Example for issue #42 about spinner colors
git checkout -b feature/42-spinner-colors
```

4. **Update GitHub**: Use the script to update the issue status

```bash
./dev-tools/github-project-manager.sh set-status 42 in-progress
```

### During Development

While working on an issue:

1. **Make regular commits**: Keep changes focused and documented
2. **Reference the issue**: Use `#issue-number` in commit messages and PR descriptions
3. **Keep the issue updated**: Add comments about progress or blockers
4. **Ask for help**: If you're stuck, mention it in the issue

### Completing an Issue

When you've resolved the issue:

1. **Create a pull request**: Link it to the issue
2. **Update the status**: Set status to "Review"
3. **Request reviews**: Ask team members to review your work
4. **Address feedback**: Make necessary changes based on reviews
5. **Merge**: Once approved, merge the PR
6. **Close the issue**: Set status to "Done"

```bash
# Update issue status to done
./dev-tools/github-project-manager.sh set-status 42 done
```

## Issue Prioritization

We prioritize issues using these criteria:

### Priority Levels

- **Critical**: Blocking issues that prevent core functionality
- **High**: Important features or bugs affecting many users
- **Medium**: Valuable improvements with moderate impact
- **Low**: Nice-to-have enhancements or minor issues

### Factors Considered

- User impact (how many users are affected)
- Strategic alignment with project goals
- Dependencies with other issues
- Effort required vs. value delivered
- Urgency of the problem

## Issue Labels

We use labels to categorize issues:

### Type Labels

- `bug`: Something isn't working
- `feature`: New functionality
- `enhancement`: Improvement to existing features
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `refactor`: Code improvements without behavior changes
- `test`: Adding or improving tests

### Status Labels

- `good first issue`: Good for newcomers
- `help wanted`: Extra attention needed
- `duplicate`: Already exists
- `wontfix`: Will not be worked on
- `blocked`: Dependent on another issue

### Component Labels

- `spinner`: Related to the spinner component
- `extension`: Chrome extension specific
- `website`: Marketing website
- `docs`: Documentation site
- `directus`: Backend integration
- `csv`: CSV import functionality

## Issue Resolution

Issues are considered resolved when:

1. The code implementing the solution is merged to the main branch
2. All acceptance criteria are met
3. Tests pass and documentation is updated
4. The issue is closed and marked as "Done"

## Issue Metrics

We track these metrics for project health:

- Average time to resolution
- Open vs. closed issue ratio
- Issue distribution by component
- Bug discovery rate

## Reporting Issue Status

For stakeholder updates, we generate reports showing:

- Issues completed in the last period
- Issues currently in progress
- Upcoming high-priority issues
- Blockers and risks
