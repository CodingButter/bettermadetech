# Spinner Accessibility

This guide outlines how to ensure your spinner implementation is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities who may be using screen readers or other assistive technologies.

## Key Accessibility Features

The spinner package includes several built-in accessibility features:

- **ARIA attributes**: Properly labeled components with appropriate ARIA roles and states
- **Keyboard navigation**: Complete functionality available without requiring mouse interaction
- **Screen reader announcements**: Important events like spin start and results are announced
- **Reduced motion support**: Respects user preferences for reduced motion
- **Focus management**: Proper focus handling during interactions
- **High contrast support**: Works well in high contrast modes

## Implementation Guidelines

### ARIA Attributes

The spinner components automatically apply appropriate ARIA attributes, but you should provide descriptive labels:

```tsx
<Spinner
  items={['Item 1', 'Item 2']}
  ariaLabel="Prize selection spinner"
/>
```

### Keyboard Interaction

Users can control the spinner with the following keyboard shortcuts:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Space` or `Enter` | Start spinning (when focused) |
| `Tab` | Navigate to spinner controls |
| `Escape` | Stop spinning (if supported) |

### Screen Reader Announcements

The spinner announces important states to screen readers:

1. When a spin starts: "Spinner started"
2. When a spin completes: "Spinner result: [winner]"

You can customize these announcements:

```tsx
<Spinner
  items={['Item 1', 'Item 2']}
  ariaAnnouncements={{
    spinStart: "Drawing a winner...",
    spinComplete: (winner) => `The winner is ${winner}!`
  }}
/>
```

### Motion and Animation Controls

To support users who may be sensitive to motion or animations:

```tsx
<Spinner
  items={['Item 1', 'Item 2']}
  // Respect system settings for reduced motion
  respectReducedMotion={true}
  // Provide option to skip animation
  allowSkipAnimation={true}
  // Control animation speed
  animationSpeed="slow" // "slow", "medium", or "fast"
/>
```

### Color and Contrast

Ensure sufficient color contrast between:

1. The spinner segments and their text
2. The spinner and its background
3. Any controls and their backgrounds

```tsx
<Spinner
  items={['Item 1', 'Item 2']}
  colorScheme={{
    primary: '#3b82f6',    // Blue
    secondary: '#10b981',  // Green
    text: '#ffffff',       // White (contrast ratio > 4.5:1)
    background: '#1f2937'  // Dark background
  }}
  // High contrast mode
  highContrast={true}
/>
```

## Testing Accessibility

To verify your spinner implementation is accessible:

1. **Keyboard testing**: Ensure you can operate all functions using only the keyboard
2. **Screen reader testing**: Test with NVDA, JAWS, or VoiceOver
3. **Reduced motion**: Test with "prefers-reduced-motion" media query
4. **Color contrast**: Use tools like axe DevTools or Lighthouse to check contrast ratios

## Common Accessibility Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Text not visible on spinner segments | Increase contrast between text and background |
| Animation too fast for some users | Use the `animationSpeed` prop or respect reduced motion |
| No keyboard control | Ensure focus is properly managed |
| Missing announcements | Use appropriate ARIA labels and custom announcements |

## Best Practices

1. **Always provide text alternatives**: When using icons or visual elements, ensure they have text equivalents
2. **Test with real assistive technologies**: Don't rely solely on automated checks
3. **Consider diverse users**: Account for a range of abilities and preferences
4. **Provide options**: Allow users to customize their experience
5. **Include skip options**: Always provide a way to skip animations

## Implementation Example

Here's a fully accessible spinner implementation:

```tsx
<WebSpinnerClient
  items={['Item 1', 'Item 2', 'Item 3']}
  ariaLabel="Prize selection spinner"
  ariaAnnouncements={{
    spinStart: "The spinner is now selecting a winner",
    spinComplete: (winner) => `The spinner has selected ${winner} as the winner`
  }}
  respectReducedMotion={true}
  allowSkipAnimation={true}
  animationSpeed="medium"
  highContrast={false}
  colorScheme={{
    primary: '#3b82f6',
    secondary: '#10b981',
    text: '#ffffff',
    background: '#1f2937'
  }}
  onComplete={(winner) => {
    // Focus an element announcing the result
    document.getElementById('result-announcement').focus();
  }}
/>

{/* Element that receives focus after spin completes */}
<div 
  id="result-announcement"
  tabIndex={-1}
  role="status"
  aria-live="polite"
>
  The winner has been selected
</div>
```
