# Developer Onboarding

Welcome to the Winner Spinner project! This guide will help you get started with development and understand our project structure, workflows, and best practices.

## Getting Started Checklist

- [ ] Read the project overview and architecture documentation
- [ ] Set up your local development environment
- [ ] Understand the monorepo structure
- [ ] Familiarize yourself with our development workflow
- [ ] Review existing code and components
- [ ] Read our contribution guidelines
- [ ] Join our communication channels (if applicable)

## Project Overview

Winner Spinner is a Chrome extension for raffle companies that provides a customizable spinner mechanism. The project consists of:

- A Chrome extension (core product)
- A shared spinner package (reusable component)
- A marketing website
- A documentation site (what you're reading now)
- Directus backend integration for data storage

## Repository Structure

We use a monorepo structure with Turborepo to manage our codebase:

```
bettermadetech/
├── apps/                  # Applications
│   ├── directus/          # Directus backend setup
│   ├── docs/              # Documentation site (this site)
│   ├── extension/         # Chrome extension
│   └── web/               # Marketing website
├── packages/              # Shared packages
│   └── spinner/           # Core spinner component
├── dev-tools/             # Development helper scripts
├── turbo.json             # Turborepo configuration
└── package.json           # Workspace root
```

## Key Technologies

- **TypeScript**: For type safety across the codebase
- **React**: UI library for all front-end components
- **Next.js**: Powers our web and documentation sites
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling system used across all apps
- **Turborepo**: Manages our monorepo structure
- **Directus**: Headless CMS for backend functionality
- **Chrome Extensions API**: For browser extension features

## Set Up Your Development Environment

Follow these steps to set up your local development environment:

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Node.js 18+ (avoid Node.js 23.1 for production builds)
   - pnpm 8+
   - Git

2. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CodingButter/bettermadetech.git
   cd bettermadetech
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

4. **Run development servers**:

   For the documentation site:
   ```bash
   cd apps/docs
   pnpm dev
   ```
   
   For the marketing site:
   ```bash
   cd apps/web
   pnpm dev
   ```
   
   For the extension:
   ```bash
   cd apps/extension
   pnpm dev
   ```

## Development Workflow

Our development workflow follows these principles:

1. **Issue tracking**: All work starts with a GitHub issue
2. **Branch strategy**: Create feature branches named after the issue
3. **Pull requests**: All changes must go through PR reviews
4. **CI/CD**: Automated checks run on all PRs

The detailed workflow is documented in the [Development Process](/docs/workflow/process) section.

## Communication Channels

- **GitHub Issues**: Primary method for task tracking and discussions
- **Pull Requests**: For code review and feedback
- **Project Board**: For high-level project status tracking
