# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Winner Spinner project! This guide outlines the process for making contributions and ensuring they meet our quality standards.

## Code of Conduct

We expect all contributors to adhere to our code of conduct:

- Treat all project participants with respect and kindness
- Provide constructive feedback
- Focus on the best possible outcome for the project
- Be inclusive and considerate of different viewpoints

## Getting Started

1. **Find an Issue**: Start by looking at open issues in the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/CodingButter/bettermadetech/issues)
2. **Claim an Issue**: Comment on the issue to let others know you're working on it
3. **Fork and Clone**: Fork the repository and clone it locally
4. **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch for your feature or fix

## Development Workflow

### Branch Naming

Follow this branch naming convention:

- `feature/issue-number-short-description` for new features
- `fix/issue-number-short-description` for bug fixes
- `refactor/issue-number-short-description` for refactoring
- `docs/issue-number-short-description` for documentation changes

Example: `feature/42-add-color-picker`

### Commit Messages

Write clear, concise commit messages that explain the "why" behind your changes:

- Start with a verb in present tense (Add, Fix, Update, etc.)
- Keep the first line under 72 characters
- Reference the issue number in the message
- Add more details in the commit body if necessary

Example:
```
Add color picker component for spinner customization

- Implements color wheel selection UI
- Adds color preview functionality
- Connects to spinner theming system

Fixes #42
```

### Pull Request Process

1. **Keep PRs Focused**: Each PR should address a single issue or feature
2. **Update Documentation**: Include updates to relevant documentation
3. **Add Tests**: Write tests for new features or bug fixes
4. **Check Compatibility**: Ensure changes work across browsers and devices
5. **Run Linters**: Make sure your code passes all linting checks
6. **Request Review**: Assign reviewers when your PR is ready

### Code Review Process

All code is reviewed before merging:

1. Automated checks must pass (linting, tests, etc.)
2. At least one approval from a maintainer is required
3. Feedback should be addressed with code changes or discussion
4. Once approved, a maintainer will merge your PR

## Coding Standards

### General Guidelines

- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Follow the existing code style and patterns
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Add comments for complex logic, but prefer self-documenting code
- Use consistent naming conventions

### JavaScript/TypeScript Standards

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Define proper types for functions, variables, and components
- Prefer functional components with hooks for React code
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Use ESM import/export syntax

### CSS Guidelines

- Use Tailwind CSS for styling where possible
- Keep custom CSS to a minimum
- Follow the BEM methodology for custom CSS classes
- Use CSS variables for theming and consistency

### Testing Standards

- Write unit tests for utility functions
- Add component tests for UI elements
- Include integration tests for key workflows
- Test edge cases and error scenarios
- Aim for meaningful test coverage, not just high percentages

## Documentation Standards

All features should be documented:

- **Code Documentation**: Add JSDoc comments for functions and components
- **User Documentation**: Update user guides for new features
- **Architectural Documentation**: Update architecture docs for significant changes

## Project Management Process

We track progress using GitHub Projects:

1. **Todo**: Issues ready to be worked on
2. **In Progress**: Issues currently being worked on
3. **Review**: Pull requests under review
4. **Done**: Completed and merged work

### Issue Management

Before creating a new issue:

1. Check if a similar issue already exists
2. Use the appropriate issue template
3. Provide clear steps to reproduce for bugs
4. Include expected and actual behavior
5. Add screenshots or videos if relevant

## Release Process

Releases follow this process:

1. Features are merged to the `main` branch
2. Release candidates are created from `main`
3. Release candidates are tested thoroughly
4. Release notes are prepared with all changes
5. New version is published to the Chrome Web Store
6. Documentation is updated with release information
