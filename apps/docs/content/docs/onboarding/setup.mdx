# Project Setup

This guide provides detailed instructions for setting up your development environment for the Winner Spinner project.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: Version 18+ (avoid Node.js 23.1 for production builds)
- **pnpm**: Version 8+
- **Git**: Latest stable version
- **Chrome**: For extension development and testing
- **Docker**: (Optional) For running Directus locally

## Repository Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CodingButter/bettermadetech.git
   cd bettermadetech
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

   This will install all dependencies for all workspaces in the monorepo.

## Development Environment Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create any necessary `.env` files:

1. For the web application:
   ```bash
   cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env.local
   ```

2. For the documentation site:
   ```bash
   cp apps/docs/.env.example apps/docs/.env.local
   ```

3. For Directus (if needed):
   ```bash
   cp apps/directus/.env.example apps/directus/.env
   ```

### Chrome Extension Development

To develop the extension locally:

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   cd apps/extension
   pnpm dev
   ```

   This opens a browser window with a development version of the extension where:
   - Chrome APIs are mocked
   - You can navigate between different pages of the extension
   - Hot reloading works for rapid development

2. Build the extension for Chrome:
   ```bash
   cd apps/extension
   pnpm build:extension
   ```

   This creates a distributable Chrome extension in the `dist` directory.

3. Load the extension in Chrome:
   - Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in the top-right corner)
   - Click "Load unpacked" and select the `apps/extension/dist` directory

### Web Application Development

To run the marketing website:

```bash
cd apps/web
pnpm dev
```

The website will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Documentation Site Development

To run the documentation site:

```bash
cd apps/docs
pnpm dev
```

The documentation will be available at [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).

### Directus Setup (Optional)

If you need to work with Directus:

1. Start the Directus instance:
   ```bash
   cd apps/directus
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. Access the Directus admin panel at [http://localhost:8055](http://localhost:8055)
   - Default admin email: `admin@example.com`
   - Default password: `admin`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Port Conflicts

If you see "address already in use" errors:

```bash
# Check what's using a specific port (e.g., 3000)
lsof -i :3000

# Kill the process using that port
kill -9 <PID>
```

#### Node Version Issues

If you encounter compatibility issues:

```bash
# Use nvm to switch Node versions
nvm use 18
```

#### pnpm Workspace Issues

If packages aren't linking correctly:

```bash
# Clean and reinstall dependencies
pnpm clean
pnpm install
```

#### Extension Development Issues

If the extension doesn't load properly:

1. Check for errors in Chrome's extension page (`chrome://extensions/`)
2. Look at the extension's background script console by clicking "background page" in the extension details
3. Verify that all permissions are configured correctly in `manifest.json`

## IDE Configuration

### VS Code Setup

We recommend using VS Code with the following extensions:

- ESLint
- Prettier
- Tailwind CSS IntelliSense
- Chrome Debugger
- GitHub Copilot (optional)

A `.vscode` directory with recommended settings is included in the repository.

### WebStorm/IntelliJ Setup

Configure your IDE to:

- Use the TypeScript version from `node_modules`
- Enable ESLint and Prettier integrations
- Set up file watchers for lint-on-save functionality
