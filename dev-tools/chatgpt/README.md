## ChatGPT Tools

```
<<SHELL: command>>         # Execute a shell command
<<SCRIPT: bash_script>>    # Create and run a temporary script
<<MSG: message>>           # Display an important message to the user
<<ASK: question>>          # Ask the user a question and get input
<<CONFIRM: question>>      # Ask for yes/no confirmation
<<SELECT: question | opt1, opt2, opt3>>  # Let user select from options
```

## Examples

```bash
# Create a full React component
chatgpt "Create a React form component with validation"

# Install and configure software
chatgpt "Install and configure Nginx as a reverse proxy"

# System diagnostics
chatgpt "Check my system for performance issues"
```

## Script Mode

The script command allows you to run multi-line bash scripts:

```bash
# Run a script from inline content
chatgpt script "for i in {1..5}; do echo \$i; done"

# Run a script from a file
chatgpt script -f path/to/script.sh

# Show verbose output including script content
chatgpt script -v "echo 'Hello World'"

# Skip confirmation prompt
chatgpt script -y "sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y"
```
