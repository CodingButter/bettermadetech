# Optimize spinner package performance

## Description
The spinner package needs performance optimization to ensure smooth rendering and animation across all supported platforms, particularly on mobile devices and the Chrome extension.

## Tasks
- [ ] Optimize React rendering with memoization 
- [ ] Implement animation optimizations for smoother spinning effects
- [ ] Optimize CSS with hardware acceleration
- [ ] Minimize unnecessary re-renders
- [ ] Add performance utility functions
- [ ] Implement proper cleanup in useEffect hooks
- [ ] Use requestAnimationFrame for animations

## Acceptance Criteria
- Spinner animations run at a consistent 60fps on target devices
- All tests continue to pass after optimizations
- No regressions in functionality
- Performance improvements are documented
- Animation is smooth and hardware-accelerated
