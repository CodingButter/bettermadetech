# Winner Spinner by BetterMadeTech

## Project Overview

Winner Spinner is a customizable, brandable Chrome extension designed to revolutionize the way independent raffle companies reveal winners during live events. Rather than scrolling through spreadsheets or relying on basic randomizers, Winner Spinner transforms the winning moment into a dynamic, visual experience — without influencing the outcome itself.

Our software **does not select** the winning ticket; it simply **displays** the pre-determined winner in an exciting, engaging, and professional way.

## Purpose and Vision

The raffle industry thrives on excitement, anticipation, and trust. Yet, the tools most independent raffle companies use today — Google Sheets, basic random.org lists, or cookie-cutter tumblers from larger platforms like WhatsNot — fail to elevate the moment where it matters most: **the winner reveal.**

Winner Spinner exists to:

- Enhance the professionalism and perceived legitimacy of independent raffles.
- Offer customizable, brand-specific displays that help companies **stand out**.
- Create shareable, memorable moments during live streams that drive **customer retention and marketing content**.
- Modernize a dated and visually flat winner announcement process without disrupting the trusted workflows companies already use.

---

## Core Functionality

- **Display Only:**  
  Winner Spinner does not modify or influence the selection of winners. Companies use their existing trusted method (such as Google's random number generator) to determine the winner. Our tool is strictly for enhancing the visual reveal.

- **CSV File Integration:**  
  Companies upload a CSV containing their participant and ticket data. This data is parsed and ready for rapid winner lookup and presentation.

- **Brand Customization:**  
  Each raffle company can customize:

  - Spinner colors
  - Logo placement
  - Background visuals
  - Spinner sound effects (optional future feature)

- **Lightweight Installation:**  
  As a Chrome extension, Winner Spinner is easy to install, easy to configure, and ready to run on platforms like Facebook Live or Twitch without complicated setup.

- **Performance Optimized:**  
  Built using Next.js, TailwindCSS, and TypeScript for speed, responsiveness, and reliability.

## Why This Product Should Exist

Currently, independent raffle companies face two poor choices:

1. **Use spreadsheets or random.org results** — flat, boring, and unprofessional.
2. **Use proprietary tumblers from service providers like WhatsNot** — but only if they give up control and move their business to those platforms.

There is a growing market of **independent rafflers** who want the freedom to build their brand and retain customer trust without sacrificing showmanship.  
**Winner Spinner bridges that gap** by providing a professional reveal tool that enhances, rather than replaces, the raffler's workflow.

## Target Market

- **Primary:**  
  Independent raffle companies operating through Facebook Live, Instagram Live, Twitch, or other social media platforms.

- **Secondary:**  
  Small auction businesses, online fundraiser organizers, community giveaways, and boutique event promoters.

These users value:

- **Control** over their operations.
- **Trust** with their customers.
- **Excitement** during their live events.
- **Professional presentation** to grow their brand image.

---

## Industry Gap

The current market severely lacks **affordable, customizable, non-platform-tied** visual presentation tools for raffles:

- **Spreadsheet scrolling** looks tacky, amateur, and diminishes customer excitement.
- **Generic spin wheels** do not integrate with ticket data and cannot be branded.
- **Platform-provided solutions** require businesses to operate within someone else's ecosystem (and often pay high commissions).

**Winner Spinner** provides:

- The independence of spreadsheets.
- The professionalism of a full brand experience.
- The excitement of a live, animated reveal.
- The trust assurance of an unchanged, externally verified winning ticket.

---

## Importance of the Product

- **Improves customer retention** by making the raffle moment exciting and satisfying.
- **Differentiates independent raffle businesses** from hobbyists or less polished competitors.
- **Grows brand loyalty** with consistent, professional presentation across events.
- **Supports scalability** for raffle companies aiming to expand their operations without sacrificing control.

Winner Spinner isn’t just a "cool add-on." It's a necessary evolution for modern, professional raffle companies who want to **own their experience**, **build their brand**, and **delight their customers**.

## Project Status

- Architecture and timeline are fully planned.
- Development uses modern, scalable technologies (Next.js, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, Directus).
- Marketing and onboarding strategy to be developed alongside MVP release.
