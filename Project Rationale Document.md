# Project Rationale Document

### Purpose

This document serves as a companion reference to the Project Timeline. Its goal is to explain the _why_ behind every major task and milestone. It outlines how each component fits into the broader product strategy, what it should accomplish, and what is required for it to be considered complete. Use this when starting any major task to clarify your focus and reduce ambiguity.

### Scope of Work Document

**Why it exists:**  
Before building anything, you need to understand what you're building. This document defines the overall vision and the boundaries of the project. It breaks the work into logical pieces, helping you stay aligned with your goals and avoid scope creep.

**Completion expectations:**

- Define the main project components and tools (Chrome extension, website, stack choices).
- Outline all milestones and when they're expected to be delivered.
- Break down weekly goals into daily, time-estimated tasks.
- Include a written scope summary that captures the entire intent in a few paragraphs.

---

### Project Rationale Document

**Why it exists:**  
It's not enough to know _what_ you're doing—you need to know _why_. This document ensures your workflow reflects priorities and dependencies, not just tasks on a list. It helps you make smart tradeoffs if you're low on time or something takes longer than planned.

**Completion expectations:**

- Clearly explain the logic behind the order of development (e.g., build core features before UI polish).
- Define what value each weekly milestone delivers (technical validation, usability, market readiness).
- Include a summary that explains your staged approach to development.

---

### Plan Next Steps

**Why it exists:**  
This task bridges planning and execution. It lays out the sequence in which tasks should be tackled to prevent rework or dead ends. Think of it like setting up a scaffolding before you start building.

**Completion expectations:**

- Prioritize the Week 1 features based on dependency and impact.
- Document which features depend on others (e.g., spinner config must exist before CSV parsing is useful).
- Identify any quick wins or stretch goals.
- Result should be a clear, logical sequence of development tasks.

### Shared Components Setup for Extension

**Why it exists:**  
Consistency across all applications is critical for maintainability, branding, and efficiency. Creating shared components ensures that the Chrome extension, website, and documentation share the same design language and functionality. This approach reduces duplication of effort and makes future updates easier by centralizing key components.

**Completion expectations:**

- Create reusable packages that can be shared across apps and the Chrome extension.
- Establish design consistency with shared themes, colors, and UI elements.
- Develop spinner components that can be used both on the website and in the extension.
- Ensure all shared elements follow the same coding patterns and standards.
- Setup shared testing and configuration for consistent quality across all uses.

---

### Chrome Extension Foundation Setup

**Why it exists:**  
The Chrome extension is the primary deliverable for this project. Setting up the foundation correctly ensures we can build features efficiently and avoid architectural issues later. Understanding Chrome's extension architecture, particularly the side panel API, is critical for the user experience during live streams.

**Completion expectations:**

- Research and document Chrome extension best practices, focusing on manifest v3.
- Establish a clean, organized project structure that follows Chrome extension conventions.
- Create a basic settings page that will later integrate with Directus.
- Implement the side panel structure that will house the spinner interface.
- Ensure the extension can be loaded and tested in Chrome.

---

### Extension Local Storage Integration

**Why it exists:**  
Chrome extensions need a reliable way to store user settings and data locally. This ensures the extension works even when offline and provides instant access to configurations without network delays. A well-implemented storage system is foundational for user experience and reliability.

**Completion expectations:**

- Create a consistent, type-safe API for accessing Chrome's storage.
- Implement caching mechanisms for improved performance.
- Ensure settings persist across browser sessions and device restarts.
- Create a clear separation between local data and data that needs to sync with Directus.
- Implement error handling and fallback mechanisms for storage failures.

---

### Spinner Basic Functionality

**Why it exists:**  
The spinner is the core experience of the extension—it's the part users interact with directly. This task gets the MVP version of that experience running so everything else can build around it.

**Completion expectations:**

- A basic UI that simulates spinning and randomly selects a result.
- No need for full styling yet—focus on functionality.
- Reads test/mock data for now, not actual CSV uploads.
- Includes basic animation (not final polish).
- Tested to confirm it outputs consistently.

---

### CSV Upload & Parsing

**Why it exists:**  
Raffle companies often manage participant data in CSVs. Uploading and interpreting that data is essential to making the spinner useful in the real world.

**Completion expectations:**

- User can upload a CSV.
- The system parses and maps relevant columns (e.g., name, ticket number).
- Handles edge cases: missing headers, extra columns, malformed rows.
- Results are transformed into a usable format by the spinner.

---

### Directus Setup Preparation

**Why it exists:**  
Before implementing Directus integration, we need a clear understanding of how it will be structured and what data needs to be stored. This planning phase prevents rework and ensures the backend supports all necessary features without redundancy or inefficiency.

**Completion expectations:**

- Define a clear data model that supports all extension features.
- Understand Directus API capabilities and limitations.
- Plan authentication flow and security considerations.
- Document schema design decisions for reference during implementation.
- Identify which components should interact with Directus vs. rely on local storage.

---

### Directus Setup for User Settings

**Why it exists:**  
You need somewhere to store user preferences (e.g., spinner behavior, previously uploaded files, UI themes). Directus provides an easy-to-integrate backend for this.

**Completion expectations:**

- Set up a collection in Directus for user data.
- Create API connection between the extension and Directus.
- Save and retrieve settings for individual users.
- Stub out real login/auth—no need for secure sessions yet.

---

### Settings Page Integration with Directus

**Why it exists:**  
Connecting the extension's settings UI to Directus allows users to access their configurations across devices and browsers. This integration is essential for creating a professional, persistent experience that builds user confidence in the platform.

**Completion expectations:**

- Settings UI communicates with Directus API effectively.
- Users can save and retrieve their configurations.
- Changes in settings are reflected in real-time.
- Error states and offline scenarios are handled gracefully.
- Authentication ensures users only access their own settings.

---

### Integration Testing

**Why it exists:**  
Before adding more features, it's crucial to verify that the core components work together seamlessly. This prevents compounding issues later in development and ensures a solid foundation.

**Completion expectations:**

- Spinner correctly displays data from parsed CSV files.
- Settings are properly saved to and retrieved from Directus.
- User authentication flow works correctly.
- Any issues found are documented and addressed promptly.

---

### Landing Page Creation

**Why it exists:**  
Even the best product needs a front door. This page is what raffle companies will see when they first learn about your extension. It's also where you'll point marketing links.

**Completion expectations:**

- Basic responsive layout with logo/title, CTA, and brief product value props.
- Doesn't need full navigation yet—just enough to promote and validate interest.
- Linked to any available documentation or screenshots.
- Utilizes shared components from the UI package for consistency.

---

### Initial Documentation Draft

**Why it exists:**
