- [x] Project Rationale Document (1.5 hours)

  - [x] Explain task priority order (45 mins)
  - [x] The project starts with documentation and planning to ensure alignment and clear expectations before implementation.
  - [x] Core functionality is prioritized first (spinner, CSV parsing, Directus setup) to validate the concept early.
  - [x] UI, authentication, and customization follow to enhance usability and prepare for real-world use.
  - [x] Final week focuses on testing, bug fixing, and polish to ensure a stable and presentable release.

- [x] Describe outcomes and value of each milestone (45 mins)

  - [x] **Week 1: Foundation Setup**  
         Establishes architecture, defines scope, and implements core functionality. This sets the stage for flexible feature growth.
  - [x] **Week 2: Feature Expansion & Documentation**  
         Adds polish, improves usability, and delivers essential user support content for onboarding and comprehension.
  - [x] **Week 3: Testing & Launch Prep**  
         Validates system integrity and prepares the product for public release with marketing and usability in mind.

  ### Project Rationale Summary

The project is structured to deliver value incrementally while ensuring long-term maintainability and usability. Prioritizing planning and foundational features early allows for a smoother development process, reduces rework, and ensures all moving parts align with user expectations and business goals.

- [ ] Plan Next Steps (1.5 hours)

  - [x] Prioritize Week 1 features (45 mins)

    - [x] Confirm development order: spinner â†’ CSV parsing â†’ Directus setup â†’ website
    - [x] Evaluate which feature is most likely to block others if delayed
      - âš  **Spinner Basic Functionality** is the most likely to block progress if delayed.
        - It must be completed before:
          - CSV data structure can be finalized (needs spinner config)
          - Parser output can be tested against real logic
          - Directus preferences can be mapped to something meaningful
        - ðŸ“Œ Notes added to related tasks:
          - CSV Upload and Parsing Part 1 & 2 â€“ _depends on defined spinner config_
          - Directus Setup â€“ _depends on known spinner settings for saving preferences_

  - [ ] Identify dependencies between tasks (45 mins)
    - [ ] Create dependency map for all Week 1 tasks (20 mins)
    - [ ] Document critical path components (15 mins)
    - [ ] Identify potential bottlenecks (10 mins)

  ### Plan Next Steps Summary:

This task aligns Week 1's development order with actual dependencies between components. It ensures that core technical work proceeds logically and avoids wasted time due to blocked features. A clear, flexible order of operations lets us pivot if needed without derailing the timeline.
